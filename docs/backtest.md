# Backtesting — `main.py backtest`

Runs one strategy over a date range and writes a trade log, five charts and a metrics summary.

```bash
python main.py backtest --symbols CF FG --start 2020-01-01 --end 2026-12-31 --strategy double_ma --cash 100000
```

## Execution model

The day loop has four phases: **OPEN → INTRABAR → SIGNAL → SETTLE**.

| Phase | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| OPEN | Rolls to the new calendar contract if the map changed, fills orders queued yesterday at today's open (± slippage) **subject to the margin check below**, arms the protective bracket (stop and take-profit) |
| INTRABAR | Bracket exits, checked against today's high/low; a level the open already gapped past fills at the open, not at the level. When one bar touches both, the **stop** wins. A stop fill pays slippage; a take-profit does not |
| SIGNAL | `on_bar` runs; orders are queued, never filled on the bar that produced them |
| SETTLE | Mark to market on settlement prices; if available margin goes negative, all positions are force-liquidated that day at the settle mark (± slippage); if equity is still ≤ 0 after that, the account is blown up and the run stops |

Signals are computed on the OI-weighted series; fills happen on the calendar main contract for that date. A strategy never names a physical contract, and never handles a roll itself.

### Rolls

**A product holds exactly one contract at a time.** When the calendar moves, the whole position is closed on the leg it is held on and reopened on the new one, at each contract's own open. If the old leg did not print that day there is no exit price, and what happens next depends on whether one is still coming:

- **Still trading** — an ordinary dark day. The roll waits, and orders queued meanwhile stay on the old leg rather than opening a second one on the calendar contract. With the old leg dark they simply defer, exactly as they would on any other dark bar.
- **Finished printing** — expired, or delisted mid-run. Waiting is waiting forever, so the leg is closed at its carried mark and the exposure moves on. That fill is at a price nobody traded, so the run warns about it and counts it in `stranded_rolls`. A non-zero count usually means the product's `main_months` no longer match where the liquidity is, and the calendar is holding contracts to the end of their life.

**The bracket is re-anchored on the new contract's price scale.** A `distance` is re-resolved against the new leg's `avg_entry`, so the basis cancels. An explicit `price` is shifted by the basis the roll realized, spec included, since the resting order is re-armed from the spec on the new contract. This is the reason strategies are pointed at distances.

Costs come from `datafeed/products.py` per product: multiplier, margin ratio, and either `commission_rate` (fraction of notional) or `commission_per_lot`. Long and short are accounted symmetrically.

### Capital limits

Two guards keep a run from trading capital it does not have.

**Orders are checked before they fill.** At OPEN, an order that would raise the margin requirement past what equity covers is **rejected**. The strategy is free to signal the same position again next bar; nothing replays it on its behalf, because a replayed order would open at a price no signal chose. Orders that do *not* raise the requirement — closes, reductions, flips into a cheaper leg — always pass, so a rejection can never trap a position inside a margin call. Rolls and forced liquidations skip the check entirely: a roll is the same exposure on a different contract, and a liquidation is the remedy for insolvency.

The run reports how many orders it refused. A non-zero count means the metrics describe a **smaller book than the strategy asked for** — raise `--cash` or cut the universe before reading them as the strategy's performance.

**A blown-up account stops the run.** If equity is still ≤ 0 at SETTLE after the forced liquidation has had its chance, the remaining bars are not traded: every one of them would be a position opened on capital that no longer exists. The summary says so above the numbers, and the metrics then cover only the truncated window.

`--slippage` is quoted in **ticks**, not price points: each fill is moved against the order by `slippage × tick_size`, with `tick_size` read per product from the same registry. One setting therefore means the same thing across the universe — `--slippage 1` is one minimum price increment on gold (0.02) and on copper (10) alike.

Every market-style fill pays it: orders at the open, both legs of a roll, a triggered stop (at its level or at a gapped open), and a forced liquidation (at the settle mark). The one exception is a take-profit, which rests at its level like a limit order and fills there, or at a better gapped open, unslipped.

## Metrics

Printed at the end of a run and rendered into the summary chart:

- **Returns** — total, annualized, annualized volatility
- **Risk-adjusted** — Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar (risk-free 3% by default)
- **Drawdown** — max drawdown and days to recover it
- **Trades** — count, win rate, profit/loss ratio, profit factor, expectancy, average win / loss / holding days
- **Capital** — turnover, capital exposure, forced-liquidation count, rejected-order count, blow-up flag
- **Per symbol** — the same trade statistics broken out by product
