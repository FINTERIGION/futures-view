"""Run-history index: a small SQLite table, one row per backtest
run. Equity curves and trade logs are deliberately NOT stored here --
they go to ``results/web/{run_id}.json`` (see ``web.config.WEB_RESULTS_DIR``)
so the index stays a few KB per row and the history list is a plain
table scan, not a JSON blob scan.

``metrics_json`` is stored via a plain ``json.dumps``/``json.loads`` round
trip, deliberately *not* run through ``web.serialize.jsonable``: a handful of
``compute_metrics`` fields (``calmar_ratio``, ``profit_factor``,
``profit_loss_ratio``) can legitimately be ``float('inf')``, and Python's
``json`` module round-trips a bare ``Infinity`` token fine between two
``json.dumps``/``json.loads`` calls even though it is not valid JSON to send
to a browser. Nulling it out here, before the API layer's
``annotate_inf_metrics`` ever sees it, would permanently erase which fields
were infinite. Everything that does reach the browser goes through
``jsonable``/``annotate_inf_metrics`` in the router layer instead.
